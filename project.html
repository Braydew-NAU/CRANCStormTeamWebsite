      <h1>High-Level Requirements</h1>
      <p>
        Our project is designed to deliver a seamless, responsive experience across both web and mobile platforms, supporting users in real time with intuitive and location-aware tools. The major requirements identified are:
      </p>
      <ul class="no-bullets">
        <br>
        <li><strong>User Account System:</strong> The application must allow users to securely create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. This includes role-based access to differentiate between regular users and administrators.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Interactive Map Integration:</strong> Users must be able to interact with dynamic map features, including generating isochrone visualizations and exploring location-specific data.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform Support:</strong> Both web and mobile versions of the application must offer consistent functionality and design, ensuring users can switch platforms without losing experience quality.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Any updates—such as map changes, data entries, or user activity—should be reflected across the system immediately to support a responsive and reliable user experience.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>User Feedback Mechanism:</strong> The system should allow users to submit feedback on their experience, which will be reviewed and used to guide future improvements and updates.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section: Envisioned Solution -->
    <section class="section team-intro-content">
      <h1>Envisioned Solution</h1>
      <p>
        Our project approach is structured around parallel development in two areas: mobile and web. By dividing the team into two focused groups, we aim to make faster, more targeted progress toward delivering a complete and polished product to our client.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3><strong>Mobile App Development</strong></h3>
      <p>
        One part of our team is dedicated to the mobile application. Their primary responsibility is to bring the mobile app up to date with the current functionality of the website. This includes implementing missing features, improving the user interface, and ensuring that the app provides a consistent and seamless experience compared to the web version.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3><strong>Website Development</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The second team is focused on continuing development of the website. Their goal is to expand existing functionality, fix any outstanding issues, and ensure that the final version meets the client's expectations. This may involve building out new modules, refining user workflows, and enhancing performance or accessibility features.
