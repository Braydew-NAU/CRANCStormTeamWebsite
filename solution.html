    <p>
        Our project approach is structured around parallel development in two areas: mobile and web. By dividing the team into two focused groups, we aim to make faster, more targeted progress toward delivering a complete and polished product to our client.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: normal;">Mobile App Development</h2>
    <p>
        One part of our team is dedicated to the mobile application. Their primary responsibility is to bring the mobile app up to date with the current functionality of the website. This includes implementing missing features, improving the user interface, and ensuring that the app provides a consistent and seamless experience compared to the web version.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: normal;">Website Development</h2>
    <p>
        The second team is focused on continuing development of the website. Their goal is to expand existing functionality, fix any outstanding issues, and ensure that the final version meets the client's expectations. This may involve building out new modules, refining user workflows, and enhancing performance or accessibility features.
